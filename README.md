# Address Script (Intern Work)
The purpose of this script was to make data within an excel sheet consistent, then use specific conditions to filter out incorrect or duplicate addresses.

The first part of the script would change cardinal directions or street names to their respective abbreviation (Ex. North -> N, Street -> St).
With the data now being consistent, it would read addresses and trigger an alert for specific instance. These instances were for Fort Wayne, IN addresses specifically. For example, if an address from Fort Wayne was 123 Wayne St, then an alert would pop up because Wayne St address require an E or W in front of Wayne St. 
Lastly, this script will also trigger alerts for any duplicate addresses containing the same full name. Once a duplicate is found, the profiles can be merged, or the duplicate profile can be deleted.

Being an intern is fun! Essentially my role as an intern here at Community Foundation of Greater Fort Wayne is to find stuff within their systems that can be more efficient or automated. Seeing the inconsistencies within data and hearing the way they handled these inspired me to write this script.
